# Yutrello Front End (React)

## Installation
The instructions below are assuming you started with the back end first.

Open the source code and navigate to `./scrum-board-frontend/src/constants.js` and set the URLs to the localhost:3000 ones. 

To get your front end started, navigate to front end folder (scrum-board-frontend) and run the following
```
npm install && npm start
```

That's it. It should compile and automatically open the app in your default browser.
