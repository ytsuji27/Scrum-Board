# Yutrello Back End (Rails)

## Installation
To get your back end started, navigate to the directory you want to install the app on in your terminal and clone down the repo with 
```
git clone git@github.com:ytsuji27/Scrum-Board.git
```

In your terminal, navigate into the back end folder
```
cd Scrum-Board/backend_scrum_board
```

and run the following to get the database created and server started
```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails s -p 3000
```

That's it. You should see the server start up and listening on port 3000
